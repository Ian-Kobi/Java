## Java

This is a collection of Projects that I created while taking CSC 210 at SFSU. 

-The Compound Interest Calculator is my first interactive math equation using code  
-The SF Marathon Project was my first experience working with Arrays  
-The Book & Library Codes are meant to be two classes that within the same project that work together. They're an example of interacting with a provided database to push-pull information across two classes.
